  Since $g$ is absoutely continuous,
  it is of bounded variation.
  It follows that all $f, g, h$ are of bounded variation,
  and the Riemann-Stieltjes integrals
  $\int \phi \rmd f, \int \phi \rmd g$ and $\int \phi \rmd h$ exist.
  By linearity of Riemann-Stieltjes integral, we have
  \[
    \int_a^b \phi \rmd f = \int_a^b \phi \rmd g + \int_a^b \phi \rmd h.
  \]
  Next, we find
  \[
    \int_a^b \phi \rmd g = \int_a^b \phi g' \rmd x
    = \int_a^b \phi f' \rmd x,
  \]
  where the first equality follows from integration by parts
  and the second from the fact that $f' = g' + h' = g'$ a.e.
  We conclude that
  \[
    \int_a^b \phi \rmd f = \int_a^b \phi f' \rmd x + \int_a^b \phi \rmd h.
    \qedhere

\begin{exercise}{7.6}
  Let $\phi(x) = x^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha > 0$.
  Suppose $\epsilon > 0$ and $0 < M < +\infty$ are given.
  Since $\phi$ is increasing and right-hand continuous at $0$,
  there exists a $\delta_0 > 0$ such that
  $\phi(\delta_0) - \phi(0) < \epsilon/2$.
  Since $\phi$ is $C^1$ on $[\delta_0, M]$,
  we have
  \[
    L = \sup_{x \in [\delta_0, M]} \lvert \phi'(x) \rvert < \infty.
  \]
  Now choose $\delta = \min \left\{ \delta_0, {\epsilon}/{2 L} \right\}$,
  and let $\left\{ [a_k, b_k] \right\}_1^K$ be a collection of
  nonoverlapping intervals contained in $[0, M]$ subject to
  \[
    \sum_{k=1}^K \left(b_k - a_k\right) < \delta.
  \]
%  We may further assume that each $[a_k, b_k]$ does not contain
%  $\delta_0$ in its interior,
%  for otherwise we can split the interval into two
%  and the sum of lengths of intervals remains less than $\delta$.
  First asume that no $[a_k, b_k]$ contains $\delta_0$ in its interior.
  On one hand we have
  \[
    \sum_{b_k \le \delta_0} \lvert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \rvert
    \le \phi(\delta_0) - \phi(0) < \epsilon/2
  \]
  since $\phi$ is increasing.
  On the other hand we use Mean-Value Theorem to deduce
  \[
    \sum_{a_k \ge \delta_0} \vert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \vert
    \le L \sum_{a_k \ge \delta_0} \left( b_k - a_k \right)
    < L \delta \le \epsilon/2.
  \]
  Thus we have
  \[
    \sum_{k=1}^K \lvert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \rvert
    = \sum_{b_k \le \delta_0} \lvert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \rvert
    + \sum_{a_k \ge \delta_0} \lvert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \rvert
    < \epsilon.
  \]
  If $\delta_0$ is contained in some $(a_{k_0}, b_{k_0})$,
  we apply the above argument to the collection of intervals
  with $[a_{k_0}, b_{k_0}]$ replaced by
  $[a_{k_0}, \delta_0]$ and $[\delta_0, b_{k_0}]$.
  The inequality
  $\sum_{k=1}^K \lvert \phi(b_k) - \phi(a_k) \rvert < \epsilon$
  remains valid due to the triangular inequality
  $|\phi(b_{k_0}) - \phi(a_{k_0})| \le
  |\phi(b_{k_0}) - \phi(\delta_0)| + |\phi(\delta_0) - \phi(a_{k_0})|$.
  We have proved that $\phi$ is absoutely continuous on $[0, M]$.
